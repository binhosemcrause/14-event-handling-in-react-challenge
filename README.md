## Description
Event handling in ReactJS is the process of managing user interactions, like clicks, hovers, or form submissions, within a React component. React uses camelCase syntax for events (e.g., `onClick` instead of HTML's `onclick`) and passes the event as a synthetic event, which is a wrapper around the native event to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Event handlers in React are usually written as functions and can be defined either inline or as methods within a component. This approach allows developers to control UI interactions in a structured and reusable way.
